## Hey!, welcome

My name is Sim√≥n, I'm a Computer Engineer from Chile. I started my career as a web developer working with PHP and .NET, to then work in data related positions. Later on I realize that, I would never read about data topics on a Sunday afternoon, but time goes fly when I learn about web development. Nowadays I'm focused on get a job as a web developer.
